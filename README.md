## Naruto Jutsu Detection

#### Introduction
This is an app for Android Wear- it is intended to run on a smart watch. The app tracks your
hand movements by means of the accelerometer. If it detects a certain hand sign, it plays the original
Naruto sounds for that jutsu and displays a relevant image.

The user experience is heavily influenced by their knowledge of the TV shows 'Naruto' and 'Naruto Shippuden' as they are what the
entire app is based on. If the user has never even heard of either show, this app will be the most pointless
and confusing thing they have ever seen.

#### Using The App
The user swipes between different screens. On each screen is an image that conveys
the gesture required to activate the Jutsu. In order to start listening for a jutsu, tap the screen. For example,
on the screen with the Shadow Clone image, the hand gestures to complete a shadow clone jutsu must be made, after
tapping the screen.

Each jutsu has a certain duration that it will listen to the accelerometer for. While the jutsu is listening,
the background music lowers significantly.

Upon boot, the app is on the home page. If the user taps at this point, a message pops up indicating to the user
to swipe right to get started.

As this is my first android wear app, I struggled to get started. I used the information [here](http://www.learnandroidwear.com/sample-3/)
to set up the main GridPagerLayout.

#### Tools Used
- Android Studio
- WavePad Audio Editor
- Cmder
- GIMP 2

#### Installing
If you have an android smart watch that has an accelerometer, you will be able to run the app. Install the apk
found in `JutsuDetection\app\build\outputs\apk\debug`.

#### Preview
If you would like to see the app without installing it, see [these](https://github.com/logiczsniper/Naruto-Jutsu-Detection-on-Android-Wear/screenshots) screenshots.
While they show parts of the app, the best aspect of the app is the jutsu detection followed by the sounds. Hence,
I do not think they appropriately represent my app.
