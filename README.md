## Naruto Jutsu Detection

#### Introduction
This is an app for Android Wear- it is intended to run on a smart watch. The app tracks your
hand movements by means of the various sensors. If it detects a certain hand sign(s), it plays the original
Naruto sounds for that jutsu and displays a relevant image.
